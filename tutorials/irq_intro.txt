Introduction to IRQs, DMAs, and Base addresses

Agenda: Discuss the definitions and assignments of IRQs, DMAs, and Base
addresses.

IRQs - Interrupt Requests
-------------------------

IRQ is a "tap on the shoulder" to the CPU by a peripheral card plugged into an
ISO slot to tell the CPU that the peripheral has something to say.

The peripheral may be: An ethernet card (NIC), modem, sound card, SCSI adapter,
                       HDD controller, COM port etc.


There are typically 16 IRQs in a typical ISA bus PC.

CONFLICT: If two devices share the same IRQ there will be a conflict. For
          example NIC and Modem having IRQ5.

If there is an IRQ conflict, system might hang or the peripherals might not
function properly.



DMA - Direct Memory Access
--------------------------

Allows channles to be opened by the peripheral to read/write directly to memory
without going through the CPU.

DMA channels: DMA0 - DMA7

For example: DMA1 - Sound
             DMA2 - FDD controller
             DMA5 - Sound
             DMA6 - SCSI

BASE addresses
--------------

Are also called I/O ports, I/O addresses, I/O port addresses, and base ports.

They are memory locations that provide an interface between the Operating System
and the I/O device.

The peripheral communicates with the operating system through the base
addresses.

Files on GNU/Linux
------------------

/proc/interrups
/proc/ioports
/proc/dma

Summary

Need more deep understanding of the kernel to understand these concepts more
clearly.
