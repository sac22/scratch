Personal opinions, not a critique.

Notes from the paper `An Evening with Berferd In Which a Cracker is Lured,
Endured, and Studied by Bill Cheswick

Has the usual layout:

Abstract
Introduction
...
Conclusion
Acknowledgment

This is more like a blog. Has original work, but not very deep.
Does not explain any concepts deeply. Explains some useful services and their
vulnerabilities. Sysadmin best practices. Explains chroot is not perfectly
secure, does not say why.

Mentions about setting up jail (but very vague).

Didn't have much take away from the paper.
Could have been more deep.
