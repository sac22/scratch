                                  TCP Wrappers

* A simple tool to monitor and control incoming network traffic
* Useful for shielding off systems and cracker activity

TCP Wrapper trick:
Runs a program in place of all other programs, which will invoke the original
program after doing some book keeping (logging).
It is also highly configurable, providing fine grained access controls.
